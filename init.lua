--- FIXME vis doesn't restore the terminal properly after exiting when 'nnn' has been called.
--- There already are functions ui_curses_save() and ui_curses_restore()
--- which are used in vis_pipe() and do exactly this but setting the
--- terminal to shell mode for the executed command
---
--- As we also would need to execute shell calls to curses programs
--- with the ':!' command, we probably would need to add a new
--- command to the sam commands (sam.c)
---
--- The curses functions needed for terminal save/restore are:
--- def_prog_mode(); endwin(); curs_set(1);
--- reset_prog_mode(); curs_set(1);
---
--- TODO make nnn options configurable
---
