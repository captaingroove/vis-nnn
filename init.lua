--- FIXME vis doesn't restore the terminal properly after exiting when 'nnn' has been called
--- solutions:
--- 1. 'e' alias for vis always appends a call to the clear(1) command
--- 2. introduce save_screen_state() and restore_screen_state() functions in vis
---    for test code, see: /home/jorg/cc/testlab/curses/leave_curses.c
---    there already are functions ui_curses_save() and ui_curses_restore()
---    which are used in vis_pipe()
---    these new functions could be added to vis.h (also in lua vis module then ...?)
--- FIXME also need to hide the cursor when leaving 'nnn' with curs_set(0)
module = {}

vis:command_register("nnn", function(argv, force, win, selection, range)
    --- TODO avoid -p- as selections disappear after a short while
    ---      and copy/paste/move is not possible. Also, -p<file> doesn't
    ---      work, as <file> is removed when exiting nnn.
